# Predicting Voter Tendencies Using County Demographics: Analysis of the 2016 Election

## Project Overview
This repository explores whether **county-level demographic data** can accurately predict voting outcomes in the **2016 U.S. presidential election**. By combining **primary election results** with a wide range of demographic indicators (e.g., population, age distribution, race, economic activity), we built and evaluated **logistic regression** models to classify counties as **Republican** or **Democratic** leaning. The project illustrates the challenges of dealing with **missing data**, **geographic imbalances**, and **multicollinearity**, and highlights how **urban vs. rural** demographics play a key role in voting patterns.
